# homelab

GitOps repository for a single-node K3s homelab cluster, managed by [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/). Argo CD watches `main` and reconciles every change.

**Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 9600X · 64 GB RAM · K3s with `local-path` provisioner. Detail in [docs/node-setup.md](docs/node-setup.md).

## What runs here

| Track | What | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apps/cove/` | Cove iOS app's backend services | Phase 0 in progress (cluster bootstrap) | [apps/cove/README.md](apps/cove/README.md) |
| `apps/gaming/minecraft/` | Minecraft Fabric server (Homestead modpack, port 25565) | Running | [apps/gaming/minecraft/README.md](apps/gaming/minecraft/README.md) |

Plus the platform layer in `infra/` that everything else builds on (see "Operators" below).

## How deploys work

GitOps via Argo CD. The default path is **PR → CI → merge → Argo CD reconciles**:

1. Open a PR with manifest changes
2. CI validates: `kubectl kustomize` renders cleanly, `kubeconform` schema-checks the rendered output
3. Merge to `main`
4. Argo CD picks it up within ~3 minutes (or click **Hard Refresh** in the UI to apply immediately)

Argo CD's root `Application` watches `argocd/` and creates child Applications for every operator and app track. Argo CD itself is self-managing — bumping its version is a PR like any other.

## Operators installed

Each operator has a runbook covering install, day-2 operations, and any manual bootstrap steps:

| Operator | Purpose | Runbook |
|---|---|---|
| Argo CD | GitOps reconciler | [docs/argocd-install.md](docs/argocd-install.md) |
| External Secrets Operator | Sync GCP Secret Manager → K8s Secrets | [docs/external-secrets-install.md](docs/external-secrets-install.md) |
| CloudNativePG (CNPG) | Postgres `Cluster` CRDs (clusters provisioned in Phase 3) | [docs/cnpg-install.md](docs/cnpg-install.md) |
| Garage | S3-compatible object storage (`images`, `postgres-backups`) | [docs/garage-install.md](docs/garage-install.md) |
| kube-prometheus-stack | Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager + node-exporter + kube-state-metrics | [docs/kube-prometheus-stack-install.md](docs/kube-prometheus-stack-install.md) |
| Loki | Log aggregation (Garage S3 backend, 14d retention) | [docs/loki-install.md](docs/loki-install.md) |
| Grafana Alloy | Log collector DaemonSet (tails pod logs → Loki) | [docs/loki-install.md](docs/loki-install.md) |

Pending Phase 0: Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Secrets

All real secret values live in **GCP Secret Manager**, split across two projects: `cove-6a685` (cove-side workloads) and `homelab-495921` (homelab-only workloads — Minecraft, Cloudflare Tunnel, Grafana). The rule is **consumer-owns**: a secret lives in the project of whatever workload consumes it, not whichever service issued it. Two cluster-scoped stores (`gcp-cove`, `gcp-homelab`) bridge the two. Nothing in `main` is ever a real secret value.

Flow:

1. The value gets created in GCP Secret Manager (`gcloud secrets create ...`) in the consumer's project
2. An `ExternalSecret` manifest in this repo declares "materialize this in namespace X as K8s Secret Y" and points at the matching `ClusterSecretStore` (`gcp-cove` or `gcp-homelab`)
3. ESO reconciles it on its refresh interval (default 1h; force-sync via annotation)

The one bootstrap exception: each `ClusterSecretStore` needs GCP credentials to fetch other secrets, so the per-project service account JSON keys are planted manually as K8s Secrets. Detailed in [docs/external-secrets-install.md](docs/external-secrets-install.md).

`*.env` files, `secrets.yaml`, and downloaded SA keys are gitignored as belt-and-suspenders.
